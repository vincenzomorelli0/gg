 * The idea is to create an event based effect system, which can also be used in functional(=side effect free)
 * programs. Currently there is no effort being made, to make the executor of such a system explicitly
 * side effect free. It is enough to ensure that a side effect free executor can be implemented
 * and use it as an alternative executor without changing the code that uses the effect system.

 * In Java the disruptor pattern, the actor model and distributed event streaming platforms (like Kafka) are similar thins.
 * This interface should be implementable via Thread, thread pools, actor model frameworks and the disruptor pattern.
