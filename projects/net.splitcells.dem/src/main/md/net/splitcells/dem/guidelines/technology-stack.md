# Technology Stack Guidelines
These guidelines describe, which technologies should be used.
There are 2 different technology stacks in general:
the classical stack is the actual source code and
the additional stack integrates the source code with the environment.
The first stack is more restricted as the second one,
because the second stack needs to be compatible with first one.
This requirement does not exist the other way around by default.
