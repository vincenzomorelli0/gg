                Tickets should be stored at the location where these are used or matter.
                It should be easy to figure out which tickets apply to a certain portion of a project.
                If a person is working on a part of the project in question,
                relevant tickets should be available with little work.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Tickets can be stored as a comment at the relevant source code location.
                Every task should start with <quote>TODO</quote>, which is recognized by many tools.
                Additional tags can be used in order to signal, which tasks may be ignored under special conditions
                or may require special care:
            </paragraph>
            <list>
                <item><quote>ACTIVE</quote>: Someone is already working on the marked tag.
                </item>
                <item><quote>TOFIX</quote>: This task points to an error.
                </item>
                <item><quote>IDEA</quote>: This task may not be a good idea.
                </item>
                <item><quote>HACK</quote>: This task marks a code quality issue.
                </item>
