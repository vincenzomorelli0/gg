> Solution For An One-Dimensional Assignment Problem

As shown above in an one-dimensional assignment problem
elements of the demand set $D$ are assigned to elements of the supply set
$S$ [1].
Every possible assignment of a demand $d$ to a supply $s$ is represented by the
variable $x_{na}$.
The actual assignments for a given solution are represented by the set $X$ as
following:

$
x_{na} \in X: x_{na} =
\begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if $d$ is assigned to $s$},\\
    0, & otherwise.
    \end{cases}
$
