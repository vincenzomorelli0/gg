        <paragraph>The Generic Allocator (Gel) is a Java framework
            providing modeling, analytic and solving capabilities regarding optimization problems.
            Gel provides tools to model problems simply and understandably,
            because without this ability such endeavours become unnecessarily hard and time-consuming.

            <quote>net.splitcells.gel.Gel</quote>
            of the core project <quote>net.splitcells.gel.core</quote>.

        <paragraph>The helper's main goal is to provide a decision tree,
            that guides developers by stating what input is required in order to reach a certain goal.
            It is highly recommended to prioritize the usage of this class.
            This interface helps the programmer to understand the possibilities
            and best practices using this framework,
            by providing the information,
            where it is used.
