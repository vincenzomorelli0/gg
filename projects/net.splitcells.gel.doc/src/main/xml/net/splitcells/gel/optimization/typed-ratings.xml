        A rating function determines
        the fitness of a given solution to the problem in question.
        They are generally used in order to guide problem solvers.
        However, rating functions can also be used in order to
        inject additional code into solvers.
        This can be seen as a form of
        <link>
            <text>dependency injection.</text>
            <url>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection</url>
        </link>
        A simple example is provided at the end of this article.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
        <strong>Note:</strong>
        During the design phase of the second version of Gel
        I searched for methods to create complex constraints out of relatively
        simple constraints. Typed ratings can be used in order to i.e. negate
        a given constraint with high quality.
        I also looked for ways to organize complex manipulations
        of solutions. However, typed ratings were of no use for the solvers
        during my master thesis. Instead, the given solution
        was queried for variables that dissatisfy certain aspects of the
        constraints.

        <title>Usage of Typed Ratings</title>
        <chapter>
            <title>The Absolute Adaptability of the Hill Climber</title>
            <paragraph>
                The hill climber for discrete values
                is able to imitate any discrete solving algorithm
                that optimizes a given complete solution.
                For a given history of intermediate solutions one has to determine
                a path in the search space visiting all intermediate solutions in the
                given order. The rating function can be used in order to determine the next step of the hill climber at
                the
                current step of the solution path.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>
                If there is a high number of neighbors at the current position of
                the problem space, then the performance of the hill climber might
                be inappropriate. This can be compensated by adjusting the problem
                space dynamically in order to minimize the number of neighbors
                during a hill climbing step. This shows that the
                solution space can also be used in order to inject code into
                solving programs.

                </link>
                Note that the implemented rating functions are based on side effects
                and are therefore not suitable for certain local search algorithms.

                A proportional object function evaluates the compliance of a

                if the rating of a solution A is X-times higher as the
                rating of another solution B then B
                disagrees the given constraints X-times as much as A.
                Constraint weights are considered in this context.

            <paragraph>
                An exact cost function is a proportional cost function
                where an optimal solution is rated with zero.
                Note that a rating function that only returns the number
                of dissatisfied constraints may not be exact. An exact object
                function needs to respect the weights of the constraints
                in questions.

            <paragraph>An invertible objective function has a return
                value with a known upper bound.
                This means that one can take an invertible cost function
                and create a negation of that function.
                This is equal to a conversion of a fitness function into a loss function and vice versa.

                If the rating of a solution A is X times higher as the
                rating of another solution B then A
                might not disagree the given constraints X-times more than B.
                Constraint weights are considered in this context.

            <paragraph>
                If a given solution is rated multiple times with such a function
                than the rating may not be the same:
                i.e. a learning program that learned a rating function but still
                adjusts its weightings.
                If a side effect free system is used, then
                this can be implemented via the concept of time.
                This can be done by adding a parameter
                to the rating function representing
                the current time:
