# Implementing And Solving A N Queen Problem Instance
In the following we'll go through the implementation and solving of a N queen
problem instance, in order to get familiar with Gel's API.

The preferred starting point for the Framework is the class
`net.splitcells.gel.Gel`.
It contains references to all entry points to all standardized workflows.
In this case we use the `defineProblem` function,
in order to create our problem.
After that we'll apply some optimization functions,
in order to create a solution.
