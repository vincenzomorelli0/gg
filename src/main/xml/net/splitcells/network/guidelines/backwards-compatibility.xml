        Only unchecked exceptions are used.

    <chapter><title>Fast Function Removal Protocol</title>
        <paragraph>If there are not many users of the affected function or
            if the migration costs for the code users are reasonable,
            the fast protocol can be considered.
            In this case, the removal should be done with a minimum amount of commits and time.
            After the removal is done, the rest of the main project's code still needs to work.
            Any required adjustments for the function removal are part of the function removal and
            should be done in the same time.
            In other words, do not break the build with a function removal.
            Other projects, that are using the removed functions and which are maintained by the people of the main project,
            should migrate to the new API as fast as reasonable possible.

    <chapter><title>Slow Function Removal Protocol</title>
        <paragraph>When a function is to be removed, that is important for code users, prefer the following protocol:</paragraph>
        <list>
            <item>Mark function as deprecated and thereby create compile time warnings.</item>
            <item>Create warning log message,  when the deprecated method is executed.
                Users, maintainers and developers are thereby warned about the deprecation.</item>
            <item>Create error log message, in order to create urgency.</item>
            <item>Move the deprecated function to another project, so it's not included in the project.
                Instead the function will be injected into the project via the other project.
            </item>
        </list>
