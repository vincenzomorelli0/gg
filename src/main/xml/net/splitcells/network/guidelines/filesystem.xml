        <title>File And Folder Names</title>
        <paragraph>File and folder names should comply with the regular expression <quote>\.?[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*([\-][a-zA-Z0-9]+)*([\.][a-zA-Z0-9]+)*</quote>.
            A path complying with this grammar may look like this: <quote>/home/splitcells/Documents/.links-to-nothing.txt</quote>.
            Before that, underscore instead of hyphen/dashes were considered,
            because this way, non-hidden files, without their respective file suffixes are also legal variable names in most programming languages and shells.
            Therefore, this format should be very portable, by avoiding symbols with special meaning.
            However, hyphens are much more preferred by

            and are also used in

            </link>.
            The use of hyphens makes it possible to have complex file names and may also represent a path for themselves.
            Also, a file name should not be longer than 255 characters.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
            Assume and use case sensitivity, but do not rely on the fact,
            that 2 files with the same case insensitive content but different case sensitive content can be stored in the same folder.
            Prefer using only lower case file names, in order to avoid this problem.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Even though, folders suffixes like file suffixes are not common,
            it is of no use to allow different sub name separators for files and folders.
            Therefore, it is not allowed to use dots (<quote>.</quote>) instead of hyphen symbols (<quote>-</quote>) in folder names.
