        <title>Automatic Formatting</title>
        <paragraph>Automatic code styling/formatting should never remove already present new line characters,
            as otherwise it is hard to structure large code statements.
            The automatic formatting should also not add new line symbols,
            as this makes it harder to structure flowing text,
            where long lines are more acceptable.
            In most cases, during automatic formatting only whitespaces (without new line symbols) between symbols should be normalized.
