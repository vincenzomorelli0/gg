    </meta>
    <paragraph>
        We provide an open source ecosystem centered around optimization and operations research,
        in order to achieve the following:
    </paragraph>
    <list>
        <item>Provide software and documentation to create and optimize problems based on a simple but powerful assignment model.</item>
        <item>
            Empower people to model and reason about complex systems,
            built out of inter connected optimization problems.
        </item>
        <item>Enable the user to understand the results given a solver and an optimization system.</item>
        <item>Develop new optimization algorithms.</item>
        <item>
            Provide compatibility between different optimization systems.
            You have your own open source optimization software? How about working together?
        </item>
    </list>
    <paragraph>
        The sub project Crisis Network (Cin) is the main playground in order to demonstrate and evaluate the results.
        It is a game, that allows one to inject optimization problems into a shared world,
        in order to create a system with an enormous amount of complexity,
        thereby bringing the modelers and solvers to its limits and beyond.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
        A game was chosen for this, in order to a have a concept on how to create and maintain a complex system,
        that still makes sense,
        when looked at by humans.
        There is not much more demotivating, than to optimize systems,
        that are complex and have no semantic meaning.
        A game also has a very high requirement for a good UI regarding the optimization software and
        therefore incentives one to not neglect the UI too much.
        At last, a game can be advertised to a larger audience,
        than optimization software.
