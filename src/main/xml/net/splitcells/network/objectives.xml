        We provide an open source ecosystem centered around optimization and operations research.
        The main project is the

        ,
        which is a constraint satisfaction solver based on the assignment problem model.

        .
        Some of them are not strictly related to optimization and can be used in other contexts as well.

        is a good example of such.
