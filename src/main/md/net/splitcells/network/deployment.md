## OS State Interface And Its Library
OS state interface can be installed via the projects
[setup instructions](./../../../../../../projects/net.splitcells.os.state.interface/doc/manual/setup.md).

You can register its library project via `command.repository.register <path to this repo>/projects/net.splitcells.os.state.interface.lib`
for the current user's OS State Interface instance.
Executing `user.bin.configure` in the shell installs the library
for the current user's OS State Interface instance.
