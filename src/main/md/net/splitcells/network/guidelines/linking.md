# Linking Guidelines
Links should be made in such a way,
that automatic refactoring as easy as possible.
Therefore, following linking styles are preferred:
* Link a file in the same folder: `linked file`
* Any other file should be linked via `<relative link to project's root folder>/linked folder/linked file`.
  i.e. `../../../../../../src/main/txt/net/splitcells/network/legal/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin.v1.1.txt`
  or `../../../../../../src/main/md/net/splitcells/network/guidelines/gist/git.md`.
